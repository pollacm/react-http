Site for testing out API calls and requests w/ dummy data
	jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
Typically use a third party js library for handling http requests
	axios can be used for this
	https://github.com/axios/axios
	Not something strongly connected to react, it can be installed with any js code
	npm install --save axios
	In your component
		import axios from 'axios';
	In componentDidMount
		axios.get('{http address}')
	Uses promises
		axios.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
        .then(response => {

        });
HTTP Get request
	Use componentDidMount for fetching calls
Transforming data
	when you fetch too much data, transform it after you get it
		const posts = response.data.slice(0, 4)
	posting
		const post = {
            title: this.state.title,
            body: this.state.content,
            author: this.state.author
        }

        axios.post("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", post)
        .then(response => {
            console.log(response);
        });
		
		axios will turn the "post" object into json data for us automatically
		
		status 201 shows that it was successful
		
	deleting
		axios.delete("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/" + this.state.selectedPostId)
        .then(response => {
            console.log(response);
        })
